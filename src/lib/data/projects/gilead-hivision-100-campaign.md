30 years dedicated to supporting people with HIV – that’s the journey we’ve taken at Gilead so far. But we’re not stopping here. Our goal is to not only meet but surpass the UNAIDS 2025 targets: 95% diagnosed, 95% on antiretroviral therapy, and 95% with an undetectable viral load. Through our HIVISION100 initiative, we aim for 100% diagnosis rates for people with HIV in Germany.

To move closer to this vision, we collaborate with nonprofit organizations such as Aidshilfe Krefeld and Checkpoint Plus Freiburg. Learn more about the vital work of these organizations, the insights gained from HIVISION100, and where further action is needed in the following video.
