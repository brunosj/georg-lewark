Macenta Beans is a pioneering coffee venture based in the Macenta region of Guinea in West Africa. We select, process and supply green coffee beans to roasters around the world. As well as creating commercial viability, we also integrate the wider social issues of local farming communities in our practices and vision.

The farmers we work with are all smallholder farming families on agroforestry land. They use no chemicals, no irrigation except rain water, and every coffee plant is pollinated by bees and insects, which boosts biodiversity. We also reuse everything we get from our coffee cherries, converting the pulp and husk into organic fertilizers for our farmers. And as Europe’s closest coffee production country, our coffee can help you reduce your carbon footprint by reducing food miles. Finally, we’re planting trees, not cutting them down and we’re running grassroots programmes to educate and organize against the devastating effects of deforestation.

We are a vertically integrated company, so we source, select, process and market our own green coffee beans, thereby offering a fully traceable product. Most of the world’s coffee passes through the hands of many intermediaries, which makes it hard to guarantee quality, ethical and environmental standards. By bringing these processes under one roof, we can protect quality and consistency while ensuring fair and responsible outcomes for our farming communities.

Coffee is a crop that takes on average 3-4 years to come to fruition being planted. Currently, coffee farmers in Macenta receive low revenues because the markets they supply offer no price differentiation based on quality. This removes the incentive to deliver a quality product. By investing in our farmers and establishing high end practices and quality control at every stage, we enable them to access specialty markets and receive decent revenues for what they produce.
A significant percentage of our profits will be reserved for social and community-based goals. This includes actions to promote gender equality and create opportunities for traditionally excluded groups such as those with disabilities, ranging from educational projects and grassroots infrastructure to an initiative supporting local women in the agricultural sector.
