"Georg has been working with us since the beginning of our journey. He is the first professional to capture the stories and the communities behind Macenta Beans. Georg captures our farmer communities in a way that does them justice, and this is only one of many reasons why he is loved and cherished by the people of Macenta.”

\- Mamy Dioubaté, Founder of Macenta Beans

With his camera, Georg documents the story of Macenta Beans in the Macenta region of Guinea over the course of 5 years. As a one-person production, he closely follows the journey of creating West Africa’s first facility of it’s kind, attracting international business and stimulus for the entire regional economy.
