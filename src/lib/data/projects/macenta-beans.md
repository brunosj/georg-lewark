Macenta Beans is a pioneering coffee venture based in the Macenta region of Guinea in West Africa. We select, process and supply green coffee beans to roasters around the world. As well as creating commercial viability, we also integrate the wider social issues of local farming communities in our practices and vision. By investing in our farmers and establishing high end practices and quality control at every stage, we enable them to access specialty markets and receive decent revenues for what they produce. A significant percentage of our profits will be reserved for social and community-based goals. This includes actions to promote gender equality and create opportunities for traditionally excluded groups such as those with disabilities, ranging from educational projects and grassroots infrastructure to an initiative supporting local women in the agricultural sector.
