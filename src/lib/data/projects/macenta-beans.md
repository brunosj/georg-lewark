Georg has been working with us since the beginning of our journey. He is the first professional to capture the stories and the communities behind Macenta Beans. Georg studies at the Konrad Wolf Film University of Babelsberg and has authored many of the pictures and video contents you have seen about Macenta Beans. Georg captures our farmer communities in a way that does them justice, and this is only one of many reasons why he is loved and cherished by the people of Macenta.
