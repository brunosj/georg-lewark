**<span style="color:#823257;">The GREATEST SIN</span>** combines the voices of four black queer men. As individual as their life stories are, they are united by growing up in a conservative and religious home. In “The Greatest Sin” they report, how they managed to overcome lack of understanding as well as aggressions up to violence on the part of the own family. We accompany them in their confrontation with the ecclesiastical conventions that are at the root of much suffering and walk with them on part of their path to self-love and acceptance.

Directed by Gabriel B. Arrahnio  
Produced by William Eggert
