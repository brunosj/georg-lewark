WORK IN PROGRESS

Growing up in a hostile environment in the periphery of Mexico City, Do25incos career as an artist started at the beginning of a young age, inspired by the "Sonideros" in Mexican popular culture and hip hop tapes that he bought on the flea market.

His tracks as a rapper address social issues and show solidarity with migrant communities worldwide, while Daniel is fighting with (self-)acceptance of his cultural identity as a mexican “paisa” living in a german society.
