Never My Love is a queer-sensual horror short film by Nicolò Grasso. Amidst Berlin's nightlife, the lonely David is drawn into a seductive and dangerous night of passion and abyss by Jules and his partner Hanna. Inspired by Claire Denis' Trouble Every Day and David Lynch's Blue Velvet, the film blends intimacy, suspense, and a dark aesthetic against the vibrant backdrop of Berlin.
