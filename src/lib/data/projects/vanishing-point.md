This two-meter long immersive Kaleidoscope installation was built from wood, reflective foil and translucent plastic. To create the illusion of a tunnel that revolves around the spectator, Georg used a Ronford F7 tripod head to turn the camera around her own Z-Axis whilst moving on a dolly track inside the installation. The variation of light shapes and tones that reflect from the mirrored walls, are complimentary of the narration that accompanies this experimental short film.
