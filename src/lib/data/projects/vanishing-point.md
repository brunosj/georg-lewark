This two-meter long immersive Kaleidoscope installation was built from wood, mirror foil and translucent plastic. The distortion, movement and reflection of the light inside this tunnel shape revolve around the spectator, turning it into a spatial building element. To feel like looking into a real Kaleidoskop, Georg used a blablabla tripod head to turn the camera around her own z-Axis.
