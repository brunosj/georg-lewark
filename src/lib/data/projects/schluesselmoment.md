In the short film Schlüsselmoment by Cemil Sorgun and Georg Lewark, the audience is immersed in an atmospheric moment of discomfort and subtle tension. Momo, a cleaner at a gym, discovers a mysterious key that leads him into an unusual encounter with Saskia, a stressed and driven perfectionist.

What begins as a chance interaction evolves into a study of power, insecurity, and the significance of small decisions. The film deliberately plays with audience expectations, breaking classical narrative conventions and creating a unique tension through unpredictable twists.
