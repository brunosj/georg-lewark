ODRA UNPLUGGED is an interdisciplinary, experimental film workshop at the Film University Babelsberg, led by Susanne Sch端le. Master's students from Cinematography, Animation Directing, Film Music, Directing, and Production create short, poetic films in the Oderbruch border region near Kostrzyn/K端strin. The process emphasizes improvisation, chance, and hands-on craftsmanship, using analog Bolex cameras and 16mm black-and-white film. The limited film stock compels participants to make precise decisions, with all material developed and processed on-site in a makeshift lab.

The films emerge organically through interaction with the environment and its people, without a set script. Improvisation and chance guide both shooting and editing, resulting in fragmented narratives and abstract compositions. ODRA UNPLUGGED offers a unique opportunity to reconnect with the roots of filmmaking and explore the boundaries of documentary and experimental cinema. The finished works are presented locally, accompanied by music, and later showcased at the Film University Babelsberg.
