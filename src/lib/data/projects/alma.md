WORK IN PROGRESS

An unexpected phone call from her sister forces free-spirited Alma to travel to her conservative hometown in Italy. Along the way, in a search for belonging, she finds herself repeatedly confronted by differences, similarities and moral border crossings through various encounters. These inspire Alma to re-think and question her origins and identity, to challenge her traditional views and ultimately to see the local culture in a new light.

Similar to the protagonist's fluid identity, the hybrid form of the 90-minute road movie blurs the boundaries between fictional and documentary worlds. Instead of trying to stage culture, it utilizes what is available in abundance: authentic everyday life. The representation of reality is essential in the development that our protagonist undergoes. Because dealing with culture requires the representation of culture.
